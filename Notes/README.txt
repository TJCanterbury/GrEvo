Folder on inapplicable data gives you an introduction to the problem as it applies to morphology. Maddison's (1993) paper is the original discussion of it, outlining a problem. De Laet's paper is a turbid, but theoretically reasonable account of the problem in a parsimony framework. Brazeau et al. is a crude algorithmic solution that may or may not be useful.

The Likelihoods folder is generally about maximum likelihood approaches to phylogenetics and how they are approached in morphology. The chapter by Pupko and Mayrose is a readable intro to how the models are devised.

The folder on network stuff has an older paper by Jardine about computed homology and the (rather poorly developed) ideas from my grant proposal.
