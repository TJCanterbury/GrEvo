# GrEvo the Graph Evolver is a work in progress

## Use:

Enter the 2 graphs, the one you want to start at and the one you want to evolve to, how many perturbations of the first graph to try each generation of the climbing algorithm, a results file name for storing the steps taken... if it ever completes and the number of attempts before a graph is determined a dead end.
Example run:

python3 GrEvo2.py ../NuPond/f.txt ../NuPond/e.txt 200 ../Results/fe.txt 3
